     TODO: option -p is not documented.

    - Do not output anything to syslog if not explicitly enabled.
    
    - New option -q <n> suppresses all normal output but exits with
    status code 0 if at least n packets have been received, and 1
    otherwise.

    - New option --select/-N which for live pcap input uses select()
    to check for new packets. This is primarily for testing purposes
    and shouldn't produce any different results. The code mimics
    pretty closely how the Bro NIDS uses select() on pcap file
    handles.
    
    - Fix disabling option -d when compiled without DAG support. (Justin Azoff)
    
    - autotools compatibility fixes. 

    - Man page contributed by Justin Azoff.

    - Fixed potential segfault.
